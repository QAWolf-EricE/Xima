## What is Call Recording?

**Call Recording** is a critical compliance and quality assurance feature in contact center software that automatically or manually captures voice conversations. This functionality enables organizations to:

- **üéôÔ∏è Record Conversations**: Capture agent-customer interactions for compliance and training
- **‚öôÔ∏è Control Recording Modes**: Configure automatic, manual, or disabled recording per agent
- **‚è∏Ô∏è Manage Recording State**: Pause/resume recording based on business rules and compliance
- **üîí Ensure Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for call recording and retention
- **üìä Quality Assurance**: Review recorded calls for agent training and quality improvement
- **üîç Audit and Investigation**: Access recorded calls for dispute resolution and analysis

Recording modes include:
- **ü§ñ Automatic**: Recording starts automatically when calls begin
- **üéõÔ∏è Manual**: Agents must manually start/stop recording during calls
- **üö´ Disabled**: No recording occurs (for certain agent types or compliance requirements)
- **üîê Automatic (Pause Prohibited)**: Continuous recording without pause capability

## What These Tests Validate

### Call Recording Business Logic
The recording tests verify critical compliance and quality assurance functionality:

1. **üéôÔ∏è Recording Mode Enforcement**:
   - Automatic recording starts without user intervention
   - Manual recording requires user initiation and control
   - Disabled recording prevents any recording from occurring
   - Pause prohibited recording ensures continuous capture

2. **‚öôÔ∏è Recording Control Management**:
   - Recording toolbar availability and functionality
   - Pause/resume controls based on recording mode configuration
   - Start/stop manual controls for user-initiated recording
   - Recording state indicators and visual feedback

3. **üìä Recording Verification and Reporting**:
   - Recorded calls appear in Cradle to Grave reports
   - Recording data is searchable and filterable
   - Date range filtering for recording lookup
   - Agent-specific recording data retrieval

4. **üîí Compliance and Business Rules**:
   - Recording mode compliance enforcement (automatic vs manual vs disabled)
   - Pause prohibition for sensitive or regulated environments
   - Recording state transitions and control restrictions
   - Audit trail and recording session tracking
